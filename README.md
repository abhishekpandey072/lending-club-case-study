## General Information

### Project Information
    The project is a data science project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

### Project Background
    This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

### Project Statement
    Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.

### Data Set
    The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.


## Conclusions

### Considerations for 'defaults' :
- Applicants taking loan for 'home improvement' and have income of 60k -70k
- Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have income of 60-70k
- Applicants who receive interest at the rate of 21-24% and have an income of 70k-80k
- Applicants who have taken a loan in the range 30k - 35k and are charged interest rate of 15-17.5 %
- Applicants who have taken a loan for small business and the loan amount is greater than 14k
- Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have loan of 14-16k
- When grade is F and loan amount is between 15k-20k
- When employment length is 10yrs and loan amount is 12k-14k
- When the loan is verified and loan amount is above 16k
- For grade G and interest rate above 20%
